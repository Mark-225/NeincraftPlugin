# NeincraftPlugin
WIP of a plugin used for the (mostly) german neincraft.de Minecraft server.  
This repository is intended mainly for transparency. You may modify and use the plugin or parts of it on a different server, but I will only provide support in the context of the "official" neincraft.de server.
